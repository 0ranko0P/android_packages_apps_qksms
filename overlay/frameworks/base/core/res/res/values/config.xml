    <!-- Default SMS Application. This will be the default SMS application when
         the phone first boots. The user can then change the default app to one
         of their choosing.
         This can be overridden for devices where a different default SMS
         application is desired.

         If this string is empty or the specified package does not exist, then
         the platform will search for an SMS app and use that (if there is one)
